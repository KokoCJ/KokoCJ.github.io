            Google maps probably is the most worldwide famous and active digital map for modern people; however,
            there is a world map exist before the satellite invention.

            As Londoners rely on the oldest tube system in the world, they would absolutely need a map, have you
            ever doubt about why the tube map drawing with unreal distance which composes by only horizontal straight
            line,
            vertical,
            diagonal and right angel?<br />
            <br />
            or how would you image the war escape route on map?
            <br />
            <br />
            What would map draw your surreal dream with mythology?
            <br />
            <br />
            Do you know there is a "fiction real map" such as Winnie-the-Pooh and The lord of the Ring(2001)?
            <br /><br />
            Luckily, they are all shown in the same exhibition: Maps and the 20th century: Drawing the Line, it
            curated by Tonharper, Jim Caruth and Magdalena Peszko. It is a retrospect time travel back to 20th century
            for
            a world map.
            <br /><br />
            You will be put on a certain position to view the world, a dream surreal wonderland and probably get
            lost yourself in a map if you try to!

            20th century was a critic changing time for human, we experienced 2 world wars, Spanish civil war,
            technology invention, landing to Moon, the movement vehicles became more customize and popular, all of these
            reasons transformed and developed the mapping skills and the approach forms.<br /><br />

            The exhibition divide in 5 parts: Mapping a new World, Mapping War, Mapping Peace, Mapping the Market and
            Mapping the Future.
            <br /><br />
            More and more people become a traveller as cross-continent and world-movement vehicles became cheaper,
            have
            a fair knowledge of it, postcard became a cost-effective souvenirs, map postcard is a new product from
            20th
            century.
            <br /><br />
            We got the first conclusion: Pollution and postcards, the concept of world which we have captured
            picture of
            our planet from outer space are the main projects(? product) from 20th century.

            DisneyLand(1968) as a "Hyperreal" labelled by French cultural theorist Jean Baudrillard, he critics that
            DisneyLand (as you can see there is FantasyLand, TomorrowLand, AdvantureLand on the map) is a completely
            represent the essence of America, it also invented the distinction between illusion and reality,
            DisneyLand
            makes the wonderland more real than reality.

            Some Utopia and mythical land idea generated from this era , one of the absolutely beautiful dreaming
            map: A
            mapped of Fairyland(1918) shows the previous Europe antique art style on painting that revels how people
            desire peace after war.
            <br><br>
            After the war, this world became more mess: faster movement, more immigration, more economic flow;
            meanwhile, we need more analysis methods to calculate and record this changing world.
            <br><br>
            Since early 20th century there has Choropleth maps to support political arguments, then there is more
            and
            more statistical infography maps be created, from Carribbean Free Trade to bird immigration map, from
             Liver
            Pool city map for promotion by Beatle's reputation to Casablanca(1942), from Los Angeles personal
            income(1966) to London original sketch for London tube map(1931)(The picture below). The world seems
            like
            much more mathematical than geographical.

            Take a guess, where is it on the map?
            (see the picture above)
            <br><br>
            The answer is <a

            We can escape from our realistic life, draw our dream on the map, can we escape or vanish on a map? A
            New Reason for Movement(1959) give you another alternative way to do so.
            <br><br>
            Previous spaces with several specific aspects points of views construct with time, a knowledgeable
            history, cultural critic and beautifully art aesthetic map show(...).
            <br><br>
            Map is a perspective to view the world, it takes the "god angle", but this Maps exhibition will put us
            in a worldwide context through past to contemporary, we could comprehend how this world became like
            nowadays and understanding ourselves where we are standing in the vertical horizon structure of world.
