            Hi there! This is Koko's website, thanks for visiting.
            <br /><br />
            Here are her personal blogs that she has not published to anywhere yet, those private contents becomes great
            material to architect her first coding site, including (1)Map exhibition in British Library, etc.
            (To be continue..) <br /><br />
            It does look very simple and might not look smart, but Koko is trying to learn coding herself without a
            company nor teacher, so please give her some time for this chellenge, if you have any advise or
            encouragement, or even you have the experience of learning coding and you want to share the learning
            strategy, please do not hesitage to leave a message to her!
        </p>
